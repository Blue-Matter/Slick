The Kobe tab includes an option to display the data as a Kobe time plot, which shows the percentage of runs that fall in each of the Kobe quadrants in each projection year.",""
"A table of performance indicators for each management procedure, with colored shading to indicate better/worse performance.",""
"Also sometimes referred to as Radar charts or web diagrams, these plots show results for three or more performance indicators, each represented on an axis starting from the same center point.",""
"A scatter plot comparing two performance indicators.",""
