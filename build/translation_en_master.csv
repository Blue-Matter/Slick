"Overall"
"By Operating Model"
"All performance indicators are defined such that higher values mean better performance and lower values mean worse performance."
"Results can also be shown as violin plots by selecting the button on the right."
"Violin plots are similar to boxplots, except that they also show the probability density of data at different values. The width of the violin plot indicates the proportion of data points that are in each region of the plot; i.e., wide areas of the plot indicate a relatively large number of data points in that region, while narrow areas of the plot indicate few data points. The plots extend the full range of the data values."

"How to use Slick"
"Load a Slick Data File:"
"To use Slick, you need to either choose from one of the examples on the right, or upload a Slick Data file."
"Consult the"

"Explore the Results:"
"After a Slick Data File is loaded, the App will navigate to an Overview page which provides a summary of the information contained in the Slick Data File, and links to Slick's data visualization pages."

"This chart compares trade-offs in"
" management procedures for "
" operating models by measuring two co-dependent performance metrics, typically a measure of fishing mortality (vertical axis) and biomass (horizontal axis)"
"The large colored dots represent the median value for the final year of the projection period: "
"The small colored dots indicate the median value in the first year of the projections, and the colored lines show how the median values change over time."
"The white dotted lines around dots are error bars. The default represents"
"percentiles, but that can be changed using the ""Percentiles"" scale at the right. The error bars can be removed with the checkbox on the right side."
"This chart compares the projected median values for "
"operating models over time for "
"management procedures and shows the levels of uncertainty."
"Segments within each bar are another way of looking at the error bars in the Kobe plot. They show the percentage of runs that fall in each of the Kobe quadrants in each projection year."

"About the Plots"
"Plots the time series of a user-specified variable (e.g., yield, biomass) during the historical period and the projection period for each management procedure."
"A box plot, also called a box and whisker plot, displays the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum from a set of results. The boxplot tab includes an option to display the data as a violin plot, which is similar to a boxplot but also shows the density of data at different values."
"A trade-off plot comparing the performance of MPs with respect to biomass (on the x-axis) and fishing mortality (on the y-axis).  The Kobe tab includes an option to display the data as a Kobe time plot, which shows the percentage of runs that fall in each of the Kobe quadrants in each projection year."
"A table of performance indicators for each management procedure, with colored shading to indicate better/worse performance."
"Also sometimes referred to as Radar charts or web diagrams, these plots show results for three or more performance indicators, each represented on an axis starting from the same center point."
"A scatter plot comparing two performance indicators."
